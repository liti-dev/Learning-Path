# Tia's Learning Path 

I started off learning how to code for nearly a year but haven't kept track of my progress. I was lazy. I thought what I learn each day is too trivial to be penned down. 
However, I've realised my memory was not as good, documenting my learning is crucial to retrieve such knowledge for later use. Also, this doc may be helpful for some beginners out there one day.

First, I have to admit that I'm very lucky. I won a scholarship into a local coding bootcamp and there are many people who support me. Despite this, I'd like to point out that intensive coding bootcamp was not for me. For details, please have a look at [*What I learned after quitting my coding bootcamp.*](https://tiacancode.hashnode.dev/what-ive-learned-after-quitting-my-coding-boot-camp-ckr54typw03a7sls10sa5aikt)
